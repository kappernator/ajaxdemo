Ajax demo application implemented using AngularJS

It is based on the AngularJS sekeleton (https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).

I started with the Wine Cellar application taken from here.

I had to exchange the PHP backend to a Python/mongodb one.

Another important thing I had to add is testing.



Run ajaxdemo

I personaly use Python to serve the demo (if you are a node.js user: node scritps/web-server.js):
cd app
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
