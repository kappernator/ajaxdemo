Ajax demo application implemented using AngularJS

It is based on the AngularJS sekeleton (https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).

I started with the Wine Cellar application taken from here.

I had to exchange the PHP backend to a Python/mongodb one.

Another important thing I had to add is testing.
